# Preface

This is before the book starts. It describes the reason why I started this book project.

(This is the before-David times.)

1 Samuel 3:1-14 "The boy Samuel ... or offering forever."

1 Samuel 4:1b-18a "Now the Israelites went out to fight ... he was an old man and heavy."

...the Philistines took the ark from Ebenezer ro Ashdod, and from there to the temple of Dagon, from there to Gath, from there to Ekron...

1 Samuel 5:10b-12 "As God's ark came to Ekron ... the cry of the city went up to heaven."

...the ark was eventually sent back to Israel...

1 Samuel 7:2-6 "It was a long time, 20 years ... Samuel was leader of Israel."
