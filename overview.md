# Preface

This is before the book starts. It describes the reason why I started this book project.

# The Demise of the House of Eli and the Rise of Samuel as Prophet

(This is the before-David times.)

1 Samuel 1:20 "Elkanah lay with his wife .... asked the Lord for him."

1 Samuel 1:24-28 "After he was weaned ... worshiped the Lord there."

...time passes...

1 Samuel 2:22-26 "Now Eli, who was very old ...in favor with the Lord and men."

1 Samuel 3:1-14 "The boy Samuel ... or offering forever."

1 Samuel 4:1b-18a "Now the Israelites went out to fight ... he was an old man and heavy."

...the Philistines took the ark from Ebenezer ro Ashdod, and from there to the temple of Dagon, from there to Gath, from there to Ekron...

1 Samuel 5:10b-12 "As God's ark came to Ekron ... the cry of the city went up to heaven."

...the ark was eventually sent back to Israel...

1 Samuel 7:2-6 "It was a long time, 20 years ... Samuel was leader of Israel."

1 Samuel 7:15-17 "Samuel continued as judge ... an altar to the Lord."

# The Rise and Fall of the First Human King of Israel

> 1 Chronicles 9:35-44 "Jeiel the father of Gibeon ... the sons of Azel."

1 Samuel 8:1-22 "When Samuel grew old ... go back to his own town."

1 Samuel 10:17-25 "Samuel summoned the people ... each to his own home."

1 Samuel 11:1-15 "Nahash the Ammonite ... all Israel held a great celebration."

> 1 Samuel 13:1 "Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-two years."

1 Samuel 13:2-14 "Saul chose three thousand men ... the Lord's command."

TODO: is this referencing a law? what did Saul do wrong here?

1 Samuel 14:47-48,52 "After Saul had assumed rule ... who had plundered them." "All the days ... into his service."

1 Samuel 15:1-35 "Samuel said to Saul ... king over Israel."

# David

> Matthew 1:2-17 "Abraham became the father of Isaac ... fourteen generations."

David was born probably about when Saul became king.
